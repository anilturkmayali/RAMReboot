# IDS Open Source Strategy

## What is it?
IDS Open Source Strategy is the set of features and projects that make IDS components available via open source. It aims to create a transparent collaborative workspace that provides an overview of the IDS building blocks developed. All projects that are hosted here are developed and updated by each projectâ€˜s team of maintainers and moderated by IDSA Technical Steering Committee and IDSA Head Office.
